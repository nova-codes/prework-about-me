      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> It never ceases to amaze me that I can type at top-speed without looking at my keyboard, figure out the answer to a problem by typing a few keywords into google, retain knowledge and information for almost 15 years about one (1) specific hobby, but still pour water down the front of my shirt because i missed my mouth in general. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p> Ypsilanti, MI </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> Reading, writing, basic web design, trying to learn javascript on my own but not fully understanding the syntax or technical jargon on most websites aimed at beginners and figuring out how to get a very similar - if not the same exact - effect with CSS3. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p> Web designer/developer, but with certification. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p> Ypsilanti, MI </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> Web design has been a hobby of mine since the internet became accessible to the general public in 1997 with America OnLine. I hit my peak on Neopets. </p>
